Put your SSL certificates and public keys in here.  Ideally you should use a
wildcard SSL certificate, so that it works for subdomains too.  Note that
you will need to modify the nginx-related configuration files and the
installer itself in /install to use your domain instead of djangy.com

djangy.com.crt
djangy.com.key
www.djangy.com.crt
www.djangy.com.key
