At first, a host setup should be required and then a deployment.  Minimize overlap.

Host setup:

-assume completely clean system (includes apt-get uninstall for packages?)
-install system packages required for things to work.  Keep easy_install to an absolute minimum.
-add necessary users (right now, just gitosis. possibly a management user?)
-generate all necessary public/private keypairs
-install gitosis and ensure users have correct permissions
-create necessary database users
-do an initial repository clone
-trac and blog stuff is excluded (possibly on a different host)


Deployment:

-do not delete directories, just ensure they exist and have the right chmod settings
-do not delete repository directory, just pull (unless it doesn't exist, then clone)
-rebuild all virtual environments
-redo symlinks (cleaning beforehand)
-ensure databases and their users exist, but do not clean them beforehand
-run synced
-restart apache (gracefully, probably)
